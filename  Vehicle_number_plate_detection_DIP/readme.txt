## About

This system is designed to detect number plates in images using edge processing techniques. It preprocesses the image, detects horizontal and vertical edges, and then identifies probable regions for number plates based on edge characteristics. Finally, it extracts the regions of interest containing the number plates.

## Requirements

- MATLAB
- Image Processing Toolbox

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the cloned repository.
3. Run the MATLAB script `number_plate_detection.m`.
4. Follow the instructions provided in the script comments or modify the script as needed for your specific use case.
